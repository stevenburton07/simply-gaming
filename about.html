        <p>Welcome to <b>Simply Gaming</b> - a website dedicated to video gaming news, discussions, predictions, theories, walk-throughs, and opinions from the perspective of <i>busy professionals</i>, fathers, and students who also just happen to be <i>very passionate</i> gamers whenever we can get the chance! We are often compared to <a href="https://www.ign.com" target="_blank">IGN</a>, though we just focus on what matters most. <b>GAMING</b>.</p>

        <!-- Permission granted in the fall 2019 via phone call -->
        <p>Here is what Richard Boil had to say about our walk-throughs:</p>

        <blockquote id="puzzles">"As a father, it is hard to find the time to solve the puzzles, or find the next thing to do in a game when you only get maybe an hour to yourself every day. Simply Gaming makes it easy to understand what the next objective is and how to accomplish it."</blockquote>

        <p>Simply Gaming is a family friendly website. We <i>do not</i> use vulgarity of any kind, and keep content clean for all ages. <a href="index.html#nintendo">Nintendo</a> may or may not be our favorite because they tend to be more family friendly than their other competitors. We hope you enjoy your experience with us!</p>

        <p><b>Sincerely,</b></p>
        <p><i>Steven Burton <br> Simply Gaming CEO</i></p>
